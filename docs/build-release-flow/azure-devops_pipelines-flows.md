# Microsoft Azure DevOps Pipelines flows

> all the pipelines definitions and its templates they're defined inside of the directory **[.azure-pipelines](../../.azure-pipelines)**

## Abastract flow

> view to a single application from inside of the mono repository

### Build and deploy to development server

### Build and deploy to production server

![abstract build release prod flow](assets/abstract_build-cd_prod_flow.png)

## Build Flows

### CI (Continuous Integration) flows

#### Pull Request

> Triggered when there is any new pull request that targets the **develop** branch
>
> The main goal of this pipeline is to validate the code from the pull request

![ci pull requests](assets/ci_pull-requests.png)

üìù&nbsp;&nbsp;**.azure-pipelines/ci/pull-requests.yml**

#### Branches

> Triggered when there is any `git push` to the **master** or **develop** branch
>
> This pipeline will run the validation, build and branch build publish of the applications that needs to be executed

![ci branches](assets/ci_branches.png)

üìù&nbsp;&nbsp;**.azure-pipelines/ci/branches.yml**

‚ö†Ô∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;to run this pipeline you must have created a GitHub PAT and upload it to the Azure DevOps Pipelines Library as a Secure file. **Instructions:** [Create and use a GitHub PAT](github-pat.md)

### Manually triggered flows

> Like the name suggests, this following flow will be triggered manually by the developer on the Azure DevOps

#### Build all applications

![manually trigger build all](assets/manually_build_all.png)

üìù&nbsp;&nbsp;**.azure-pipelines/manually/build-all.yml**

‚ö†Ô∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;to run this pipeline you must have created a GitHub PAT and upload it to the Azure DevOps Pipelines Library as a Secure file. **Instructions:** [Create and use a GitHub PAT](github-pat.md)

#### Build one application

![manually build one app](assets/manually_build_one.png)

It should be created one by application and use the template **.azure-pipelines/manually/templates/build-one.yml**

‚ö†Ô∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;to run this pipeline you must have created a GitHub PAT and upload it to the Azure DevOps Pipelines Library as a Secure file. **Instructions:** [Create and use a GitHub PAT](github-pat.md)

## Release Flows

> CD - Continuous Deployment

![continuous deploy one app](assets/cd_app.png)

It should be created one by application, environment (`prod` - production or `dev` - development) and use the template **.azure-pipelines/cd/templates/deploy-one.yml**

‚ö†Ô∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;to run this pipeline you must have created two variable groups on the pipelines library (remember to allow the access to all the pipelines):

- `cd-vars_commons` it will be used to all CD (**_continuous deployment_**) pipelines
  - `azureSubscriptionID` - the subscription ID
  - `azureSubscriptionResource` - the MS Azure DevOps service connection name
- `cd-vars_$ENV_$appName` which should contains
  - `STATUS` - it must have the value `active` to update the Azure Cloud Storage and Azure Could CDN
  - to update the storage
    - `azureStorageName`
  - to update the cdn
    - `azureResourceGroupName` - name of the service connection added to the `Service connections` under the MS Azure DevOps project settings
    - `azureCdnEndpointName`
    - `azureCdnProfileName`
